https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-total-time-spent-by-each-employee/description/ 

- Solution by group by and sum function
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT event_day AS 'day', emp_id, SUM(out_time - in_time) AS 'total_time'
FROM Employees
GROUP BY event_day, emp_id
ORDER BY day
```

---

- Recommendation in Pandas
```
import pandas as pd

def total_time(employees: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    employees["total_time"] = employees["out_time"] - employees["in_time"]
    employees = employees.groupby(["event_day", "emp_id"])["total_time"].sum().reset_index()
    employees.rename({"event_day": "day"}, axis=1, inplace=True)
    employees["day"] = employees["day"].astype(str)
    return employees
    
```
