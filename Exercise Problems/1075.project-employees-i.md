- Solution 1:
```
-- Write your MS SQL query statement below
SELECT pe.project_id, ROUND(SUM(pe.experience_years) * 1.0 / COUNT(pe.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM
    (SELECT p.project_id, e.experience_years
    FROM Project p 
    INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id) pe
GROUP BY pe.project_id
ORDER BY pe.project_id

```

- Solution 2: (Recommendation)
```
-- Write your T-SQL query statement below
SELECT p.project_id, ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years * 1.0), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p 
    INNER JOIN Employee e ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY p.project_id
ORDER BY p.project_id

```
**Python**
```
import pandas as pd

def project_employees_i(project: pd.DataFrame, employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged_df = pd.merge(project, employee, on = 'employee_id', how = 'left')
    res = merged_df.groupby(['project_id'], as_index = False)['experience_years'].mean().round(2)
    return res.rename(columns = {'experience_years': 'average_years'})
    
```
