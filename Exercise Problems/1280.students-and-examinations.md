- Solution 1:
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, c.subject_name, COUNT(e.subject_name) AS 'attended_exams'
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects c
LEFT JOIN Examinations e on s.student_id = e.student_id AND c.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP By s.student_id, s.student_name, c.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, c.subject_name

```

- Solution 2: (Recommendation)
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name, ISNULL(grouped.attended_exams, 0) AS 'attended_exams'
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT student_id, subject_name, COUNT(*) AS 'attended_exams'
    FROM Examinations
    GROUP BY student_id, subject_name
) grouped
on s.student_id = grouped.student_id AND sub.subject_name = grouped.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name

```
**Python**
```
import pandas as pd

def students_and_examinations(students: pd.DataFrame, subjects: pd.DataFrame, examinations: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    grouped = examinations.groupby(['student_id', 'subject_name']).size().reset_index(name = 'attended_exams')
    all_id_subjects = pd.merge(students, subjects, how = 'cross')
    id_subjects_count = pd.merge(all_id_subjects, grouped, on = ['student_id', 'subject_name'], how = 'left')

    id_subjects_count['attended_exams'] = id_subjects_count['attended_exams'].fillna(0).astype(int)
    id_subjects_count.sort_values(['student_id', 'subject_name'], inplace = True)

    return id_subjects_count[['student_id', 'student_name', 'subject_name', 'attended_exams']]
