- Solution
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT * FROM Transactions WHERE amount > 0
)
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS 'count_no_trans'
FROM CTE
RIGHT JOIN Visits v ON v.visit_id = CTE.visit_id
WHERE amount IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id
```

- Recommendation
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS 'count_no_trans'
FROM Transactions t
RIGHT JOIN Visits v ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id
```

- Recommendation in Pandas
```
import pandas as pd

def find_customers(visits: pd.DataFrame, transactions: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    visited = transactions['visit_id'].drop_duplicates()
    not_visited = visits[~visits['visit_id'].isin(visited)]['customer_id'].value_counts().reset_index()
    return not_visited.rename(columns={'count': 'count_no_trans'})
    
```
