- Solution 2: (Recommendation)
```
public class Solution {
    public string DayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        string[] week = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"};
        int[] monthDays = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30};

        var days = 365 * (year - 1971) + (year - 1969) / 4;
        for (var i = 0; i < month - 1; i++)
        {
            days += monthDays[i];
        }
        if ((year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)) && month >= 3)
            days += 1;
        days += day;
        return week[(days + 3) % 7];
    }
}
```
**Python**
```
class Solution:
    def dayOfTheWeek(self, day: int, month: int, year: int) -> str:
        week = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
        monthDays = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30]
        days = 0

        days += 365 * (year - 1971) + (year - 1969) // 4
        days += sum(monthDays[:month-1])
        if (year % 400 == 0 or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0)) and month >= 3:
            days += 1
        days += day

        return week[(days + 3) % 7]
