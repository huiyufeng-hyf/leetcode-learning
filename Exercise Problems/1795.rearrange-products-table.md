- Solution by CTE
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
with CTE as (
    select product_id, 'store1' as store, store1 as 'price'
    from Products
    union
    select product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 as 'price'
    from Products
    union 
    select product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 as 'price'
    from Products
)
select * from CTE
where price is not null
```

- Recommendation 1 by combining the tables
```
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
select product_id, 'store1' as store, store1 as price
from products
where store1 is not null

union
select product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 as price
from products
where store2 is not null

union
select product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 as price
from products
where store3 is not null
```
**Python**
```
import pandas as pd

def rearrange_products_table(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    a = products.loc[products['store1'].notna(), ['product_id', 'store1']]
    a['store'] = "store1"
    a.rename(columns={'store1':'price'}, inplace=True)
    a = a[['product_id', 'store', 'price']]

    b = products.loc[products['store2'].notna(), ['product_id', 'store2']]
    b['store'] = 'store2'
    b.rename(columns={'store2':'price'}, inplace=True)
    b = b[['product_id', 'store', 'price']]

    c = products.loc[products['store3'].notna(), ['product_id', 'store3']]
    c['store'] = 'store3'
    c.rename(columns={'store3':'price'}, inplace=True)
    c = c[['product_id', 'store', 'price']]

    answer = pd.concat([a, b, c])
    return answer

- Recommendation 2 by toast table in Pandas
```
import pandas as pd

def rearrange_products_table(products: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = products.melt(id_vars='product_id', var_name='store', value_name='price')
    df = df.dropna(axis=0)
    return df
    
```
